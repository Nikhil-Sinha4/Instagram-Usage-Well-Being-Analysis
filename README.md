# Instagram-Usage-Well-Being-Analysis
Behavioral data analysis exploring relationships between Instagram usage intensity, stress levels, and user well-being using large-scale user data.
## Project Overview
This project analyzes how Instagram usage patterns relate to user well-being indicators such as happiness and stress levels using a large-scale behavioral dataset containing over 1.5 million user records.
The goal is to identify meaningful behavioral trends and demonstrate large-scale data analysis, segmentation, and insight storytelling.
## Problem Statement
How does daily Instagram usage intensity influence user happiness across different stress levels and demographic groups?
## Dataset Summary
The dataset contains:
           
           User demographics
           Daily Instagram usage minutes
           Self-reported stress levels
           Happiness score indicators
           Geographic and behavioral attributes
## Methodology
1. Data Cleaning:
   
           Standardized inconsistent categorical labels
           Validated data types and ranges
           Removed redundancy
3. Feature Engineering
   Users were segmented into usage groups:
   
           Low Usage (< 1 hour/day)
           Moderate Usage (1–2 hours/day)
           Heavy Usage (> 2 hours/day)
5. Exploratory Analysis
   
           Usage intensity vs happiness trends
           Stress-level based behavioral comparisons
           Demographic pattern exploration
7. Visualization
   Created comparative trend charts to identify behavioral relationships.
## Key Insights
Increased Instagram usage is associated with lower happiness levels.

High-stress users show the strongest negative trend.

Usage intensity may amplify psychological stress effects.
## Limitations
Observational dataset (no causal inference).
Self-reported psychological metrics may introduce bias.
Segmentation thresholds are behaviorally intuitive, not fully data-driven.
## Future Improvements
Regression modelling for statistical validation
Clustering-based behavioral segmentation
Longitudinal usage trend analysis
## Tools & Technology
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook
